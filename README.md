# auto-character-sheet
LaTeX character sheets with auto-filling fields

## Credits
Original `main.tex` file shamelessly stolen from [this repo](https://github.com/michaelplews/DnD-character-sheets/) (see [this commit](https://github.com/michaelplews/DnD-character-sheets/commit/049a69b495acef5d8db7cd8d4a8e1a3ea988fc4c)) which stole it from [this (since-deleted) post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/2zh01c/i_made_my_bard_a_customized_character_sheet_using/) by /u/hurrayforzac on Reddit.

## Some Sheets for Inspiration
- [This sheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz2-HqllQ6XpV1BjZDVIX2tLMUk/view) apparently auto-calculates things, but it requires Adobe (so I haven't tested it)
- I like a lot of the things [this sheet](https://dnd5echaractersheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DD-character-sheet-5e-fillable.pdf) does, such as the armor penalty annotation for Stealth or the visible cues about whether abilities reset on short or long rests
